This GRUB boot menu theme is an edited version of the "Argon theme".

I did not create this but I changed small things to fit my liking.

To install

1. Clone or move directory into /usr/share/grub/themes
2. Add line 'GRUB_THEME="/usr/share/grub/themes/tyis-grub-theme/theme.txt"' to /etc/default/grub
3. Reconfigure grub 'grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg'
